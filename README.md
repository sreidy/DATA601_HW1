#### Overview
Data Source: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data
As the ongoing pandemic shifts and changes, a useful insight is to look for patterns in case numbers over time. Looking at this change in case numbers over time is known as a timeseries analysis, highlighting potential seasonality and periodic peaks and troughs in the number of confirmed cases. Most importantly, using historical data on confirmed cases to forecast any future activity.
The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has been tracking the outbreak worldwide, and publishing their data for the public on GitHub. (a real time dahsboard of the data is available here https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).
